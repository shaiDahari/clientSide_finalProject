## COLLABORATIVE TOOLS SUMMARY

Git and GitHub served as our primary collaboration platform, enabling effective teamwork despite our limited experience. We utilized branching to work on different features simultaneously without conflicts, and merging allowed us to integrate our changes seamlessly. Version control helped us track modifications and revert to previous states when needed. For communication, we used Zoom and Discord for real-time meetings to discuss project requirements and resolve issues. We also leveraged AI tools like NotebookLLM to document meeting notes efficiently. While we considered Slack initially, we found it unnecessary for our small two-person team, as direct communication through video calls proved more effective.
